# React Portfolio Website

Welcome to my React portfolio website! This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website built using React and Vite.

You can view the live website [here](https://buddhadebkoner.github.io/React-portpolio/).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

## Install dependencies using npm:

## Usage 
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

This command will start the development server and open the website in your default web browser. You can then make changes to the code and see the results in real-time.
